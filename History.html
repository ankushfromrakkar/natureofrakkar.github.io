<h5>
Sidhbari is a suburb of Dharamshala town, situated in the foothills of Dhauladhar mountains, in Kangra district of the state of Himachal Pradesh, India.
Sidhbari derives its name from a sage, Baba Sidh. It is believed by the locals that the dhuni (burning piece of wood) here has been burning for centuries and has never been extinguished even once. Hence the vibhuti (ash) is said to have the sacred blessings of the Sidh Baba.

Since 2000, Sidhbari has also been associated as the temporary residence of the Karmapa (Ogyen Trinley Dorje). The place is called Gyotu Monastery and is believed to be a teaching place for tantra vidya.

Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha is also situated here.
The small town of Sidhbari is bustling with activity due to several local attractions.

    Very near to the village is Chinmaya Ashram or Sandeepany Himalayas. In this Ashram is the Samadhi (resting place) of Pujya Gurudev Swami Chinmayananda, founder of Chinmaya Mission.
    In the village of Sidhbari, near Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh, lies what is commonly regarded as the meditation spot of Kapila. The sage who lived there is locally regarded as Sidh Baba due to his mystic powers, and hence the name of the village Sidhbari.
    Sidhbari is also the temporary residence of the Karmapa (Ogyen Trinley Dorje), at Gyuto Monastery.[1] Sidhbari is about six kilometers from Dharamshala, and about 15 kilometers from McLeodGanj, where the 14th Dalai Lama lives.
    One attraction for tourists in Sidhbari is the Naam Art Gallery, exhibiting paintings by European artists Elsbeth Buschmann and Alfred W. Hallett.
