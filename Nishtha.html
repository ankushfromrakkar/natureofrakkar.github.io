<P>Nishtha is a Charitable Trust situated in Sidhbari, a small village in the Himalayan foothills of the North Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The main objective for which the Trust has been established is to work for the benefit and development of society as a whole by improving the welfare of families with particular focus on women and children. This objective is served through activities in the fields of health, education and environment.

Our approach is to work alongside the local people for our mutual development and benefit. In this fast moving world in which major changes in our cultural perspective creates conflict and confusion we aim to encourage dialogue and learning through acknowledging individual and group knowledge and desire to live in harmony with each other and nature. Our approach is holistic and our philosophy is based on an integrated approach that is inclusive of physical, social and spiritual growth of people and nature.

Nishthaâ€™s founder and manager is Dr. Barbara Nath-Wiser a general practitioner from Vienna, Austria who has been living in Sidhbari since 1984. The health centre is dedicated to the memory of her late husband Krishan Nath Baba, who was a respected spiritual personality in the area and was very concerned about the well-being of the local people.
Mrs. Monica Ghosh

Nishtha Trust was set up in 1995 by Dr. Barbara with the help of 3 Trustees: local social activist Mrs. Monica Ghosh, retired reader in Psychology from Shimla university Dr. Kishwar Shirali and social activist Ms. Abha Bhaiya. After many years of service to the Trust and active contribution to the work of Nishtha, Kishwar resigned in 2008. The Trust is very grateful for her long-time valuable service and continuing involvement in our programmes.  Ms. Kamla Bhasin, feminist activist and founder of Sangat South Asia was appointed a trustee in August 2009.

In May 2010, Mrs. Ghosh who had served the Trust steadily and with great dedication passed away. Local resident Mrs. Soniya Sebastian has been her replacement trustee since 2010.

Radhika Saunik who recently moved into the area after a career in librarianship, was appointed a Trustee in May 2012.</P>  </H3></font>
